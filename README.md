## Text Processing and NLP

### Diffing and Patching Tools

- [GNU Diffutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/manual/diffutils.html) - an open source (GPLv3+) package which provides `diff` and other programs.
- [GNU patch](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/patch/) - apply a patch/diff file. Open source (GPLv3+).
- [patchutils](http://cyberelk.net/tim/software/patchutils/) - Patchutils is a small collection of programs that operate on patch files. Open source.
- [comm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comm) - a UNIX command used to compare two files for common and distinct lines.
- [Meld](http://meldmerge.org/) - a GUI diff/merge tool for gtk+. Open source.
- [KDiff3](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/) - a GUI diff/merge tool for KDE. Open source.
- [GNU wdiff](http://www.gnu.org/software/wdiff/) - a front-end to GNU diff for comparing files on a word-per-word basi

### *<u>Standard UNIX Text Processing Tools</u>*

-  echo (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_%28command%29) - output strings (with some possible transformations).
- cat  - output or concatenate files.
- cut  - extract sections from each line of output.
- head  - start of stream.
- tail  - end of stream.
- paste  - join multiple files horizontally.
- sort  - sorts input.
- csplit  - split files based on context lines.
- join- merges lines of two files based on commonalities.
- [uniq](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/uniq-invocation.html) - collapses adjacent lines, and makes the output unique.
- [grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html) - search for lines matching regular expressions.
- [sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html) - stream editor - a mini programming language for text processing, based on the ed text editor.
- [AWK](http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/chap_06.html) - an even more full-fledged programming language for text processing in UNIX (with some quirks, and idiosyncrasi
